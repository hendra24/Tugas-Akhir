    F distribution

    Returns the area from zero to x under the F density
    function (also known as Snedcor's density or the
    variance ratio density).  This is the density
    of x = (u1/df1)/(u2/df2), where u1 and u2 are random
    variables having Chi square distributions with df1
    and df2 degrees of freedom, respectively.
    The incomplete beta integral is used, according to the
    formula

    P(x) = incbet( df1/2, df2/2, (df1*x/(df2 + df1*x) ).


    The arguments a and b are greater than zero, and x is
    nonnegative.

    ACCURACY:

    Tested at random points (a,b,x).

    Inverse of complemented F distribution

    Finds the F density argument x such that the integral
    from x to infinity of the F density is equal to the
    given probability p.

    This is accomplished using the inverse beta integral
    function and the relations

         z = incbi( df2/2, df1/2, p )
         x = df2 (1-z) / (df1 z).

    Note: the following relations hold for the inverse of
    the uncomplemented F distribution:

         z = incbi( df1/2, df2/2, p )
         x = df2 z / (df1 (1-z)).
